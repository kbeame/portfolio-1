# portfolio

Author: Lex Myers

Done for Code Fellows 301

This is portfolio done as a static page made with jQuery. The "entries.js" file contains the data for the various portfolio
entries; the "generate.js" file uses the template in "index.html" to generate those entries.

02-01-2016: Did original setup. Attempted to use normalize.css
to format.
